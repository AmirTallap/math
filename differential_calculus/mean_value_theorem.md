### The mean value theorem(MVT)

This states that the instantaneous rate of change ( `f'(c)`, the `slope of the tangent line`) must equal the average rate of change (the `slope of the secant line`) at some point c in the open interval (a,b).


$$ \Huge f^{\prime}\left(c\right)=\frac{f\left(b\right)-f\left(a\right)}{b-a} $$

### Rules:

* `f(x)` must be continuous on the closed interval `[a,b]`.
* `f(x)` must be differentiable on the open interval `(a,b)`.
