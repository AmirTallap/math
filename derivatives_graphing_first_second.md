### The first derivative f'(x)

- Increasting & decreasing & zero

    If `f'(x)>0` (`positive`), the graph is `increasing!`
    
    if `f'(x)<0` (`negative`), the graph is `decreasing!`

    if `f'(x)==0` or is \text{undefined}, `(critical point)`, Either a local `maximum`, or local `minimum`, or \text{neither}.

    - Relative Maximum
        
        If `f'(x)` changes from `Positive (LEFT)` to `Negative (RIGHT)`.
    
    - Relative Minimum
        
        If `f'(x)` changes from `Negative (LEFT)` to `Positive (RIGHT)`.
    
### The second derivative f''(x)
    
- Concavity

    If `f''(x)>0` (`positive`), this is `concave up` or `convex`.
    
    if `f''(x)<0` (`negative`), this is `condave down`.

    if `f''(x)==0` or is \text{undefined}, this is a `possible inflection point`.

### Inflection points!

*   A point is an `Inflection point` if `concavity changes` `(i.e., $f''(x)$ changes sign)` at that point.
