### The first derivative f'(x)

- Increasting & decreasing & zero

    If `f'(x)>0` (`positive`), the graph is `increasing!`
    
    if `f'(x)<0` (`negative`), the graph is `decreasing!`

    if `f'(x)==0` or is `undefined`, `(critical point)`, the function is a candidate for a local `maximum`, local `minimum`, or `neither`.

    - Relative Maximum (First Derivative Test)
        
        If `f'(x)` changes from `Positive (LEFT)` to `Negative (RIGHT)`.
    
    - Relative Minimum (First Derivative Test)
        
        If `f'(x)` changes from `Negative (LEFT)` to `Positive (RIGHT)`.
    
### The second derivative f''(x)
    
- Concavity

    If `f''(x)>0` (`positive`), this is `concave up` or `convex`.
    
    if `f''(x)<0` (`negative`), this is `concave down`.

    if `f''(x)==0` or is `undefined`, this is a `possible inflection point`.

### Inflection points!

* A point is an `Inflection point` if `concavity changes` (i.e., $f''(x)$ changes sign) at that point.

### Second Derivative Test for Extrema

* Use this test `only` when $f'(c)=0$ at a critical point $c$.

    - Local Maximum
        
        If $f'(c)=0$ AND $f''(c) < 0$ (`concave down`).
    
    - Local Minimum
        
        If $f'(c)=0$ AND $f''(c) > 0$ (`concave up`).

    - Test Fails
        
        If $f'(c)=0$ AND $f''(c) = 0$, the test is `inconclusive`; use the `First Derivative Test`.
