### Acceleration
 Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, which is the rate of change of position. So we need to find the second derivative of 
`f(x)` or `f"(x)`.

### Velocity
Velocity is the rate of change of position, we need to find the derivative of  `f(x)` or `f'(x)`.
- If velocity is 0, there is no direction to the object or the direction is 0.
